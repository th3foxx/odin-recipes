        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li> <br>
            <li>Whisk 1 cup flour, yeast, and sugar together in a bowl. Stir in water and softened butter until well combined. <br> Let stand until bubbles begin to form, about 15 minutes.</li> <br>
            <li>Stir salt into yeast mixture, then gradually stir in 2 1/2 cups flour until dough can be picked up in a ball.</li> <br>
            <li>Knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes, adding more flour if needed.</li> <br>
            <li>Divide dough into 6 pieces and let rest for a few minutes.</li> <br>
            <li>Roll one piece into a 15-inch rope, then loop and twist rope into a pretzel shape. <br> Place onto a baking sheet and form remaining pretzels. Cover and let rise for 15 minutes.</li> <br>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li> <br>
            <li>Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a pot. Stir in baking soda and remove from the heat.</li> <br>
            <li>Dip pretzels into the water bath for about 45 seconds, flipping over about halfway through.</li> <br>
            <li>Transfer soaked pretzels to the prepared baking sheet; brush with melted butter and sprinkle with salt.</li> <br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
